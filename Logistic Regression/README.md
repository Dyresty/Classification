# Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression - Predict a **categorical** dependent variable from a number of independent variables.<br>

Example 
- Will someone purchase health insurance - yes/no<br>
  Predict based on age.<br>
  Can include more independent variables like income, level of education, family or single<br>
  y-axis will have y (yes/no)<br>
  x-axis will have age (in years)<br>


The graphs are different for classification as it is a Sigmoid curve<br><br>

ln(p/(1-p)) = b0 + b1X1 <br><br>

Logistic Regression gives us the probability of a certain category given the independent variables. <br><br>

Maximum Likelihood curve is found by multiplying all the probabilities of customer saying yes and all the probabilities of customer saying no, to get the likelihood value. And multiple such likelihood values are compared to get the maximum likelihood value. That will give the best curve.
