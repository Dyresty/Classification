Machine Learning - Classification Model Projects

**Regression** invloves predicting a continuous number, while **Classification** involves predicting a category. <br><br>

Classification is a Machine Learning technique to identify the category of new observations based on training data. <br><br>

Classification includes linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear models like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests. <br>
Wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing to leaving. <br>
##### Examples
- Customers can be classified as two types - Likely to stay, likely to leave - so as to give more promotions to customers who are more likely to leave. 
- Mails can be classified as normal, important, promotions, spam.
- Image Recognition - Classifying animals as cats and dogs. 

There are multiple Machine Learning Classification models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Kernel SVM
5. Naive Bayes
6. Decision Tree Classification
7. Random Forest Classification
