Machine Learning - Classification Model Projects

**Regression** invloves predicting a continuous number, while **Classification** involves predicting a category. <br>
Classification includes linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear models like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests. <br>
Wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing. <br>

There are multiple Machine Learning Classification models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Kernel SVM
5. Naive Bayes
6. Decision Tree Classification
7. Random Forest Classification
